# threejs-ego
A demo scene to test out transparency on three.js materials, webaudio reactiveness & unprojection.

The opacity of the material changes on the different volume changes of the audio playing.
Contains research on how to unproject a 3D point onto a 2D plane (your screen).
Notice how the 2D line perfectly follows the 3D object in the skull.
